# Whizbang Patterns

This section documents the unique architectural patterns that make Whizbang different from traditional frameworks. These aren't just implementations of existing patterns - they're novel approaches to common problems in distributed systems.

## What Makes These Patterns Special

- **Time-Travel Native**: Several patterns incorporate temporal debugging as a core feature
- **Zero Reflection**: All patterns use source generation for compile-time optimization
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each pattern starts simple and grows with your needs
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between decisions, effects, and queries

## The Patterns

- **Receptor Pattern**: Type-safe message handling with temporal orchestration
- **Perspective Pattern**: Multiple independent worldviews from the same events
- **Lens Pattern**: The Query side of CQRS with security context and tenant isolation
- **Policy Pattern**: Composable cross-cutting concerns
- **Ledger Pattern**: The permanent memory that enables time-travel
