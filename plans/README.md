# Development Planning System

This folder contains structured development plans for the Whizbang documentation site project.

## Folder Structure

- **`search-enhancements/`** - Plans for improving search functionality
- **`ui-improvements/`** - User interface and user experience enhancements
- **`performance-optimizations/`** - Performance improvements and optimizations
- **`content-management/`** - Content creation, organization, and management plans
- **`templates/`** - Standardized templates for creating new plans

## Plan Document Format

Each plan follows a standardized format to ensure consistency and completeness:

1. **Overview & Goals** - High-level description and objectives
2. **Current State Analysis** - Assessment of existing functionality
3. **Technical Requirements** - Dependencies, tools, and technical considerations
4. **Implementation Phases** - Broken down into manageable phases with checkboxes
5. **Timeline & Effort** - Estimated time and complexity
6. **Dependencies & Risks** - Blockers and potential issues
7. **Success Criteria** - How to measure completion and success
8. **Progress Tracking** - Live status updates and notes

## Status Conventions

- ‚ùå **Not Started** - Task not yet begun
- üîÑ **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Blocked** - Waiting on dependency or facing issue
- ‚úÖ **Complete** - Task finished and tested
- üß™ **Testing** - Implementation done, testing in progress

## Using This System

### Creating a New Plan
1. Copy the appropriate template from `templates/`
2. Place in the relevant category folder
3. Fill out all sections thoroughly
4. Link to this plan in related issues or PRs

### Updating Progress
- Update checkboxes as tasks are completed
- Add notes in the Progress Tracking section
- Update status badges to reflect current state
- Document any blockers or changes to approach

### Plan Completion
- Mark all tasks as complete
- Add final notes and lessons learned
- Archive or mark as reference for future work

## Best Practices

- **Be specific** - Vague tasks are hard to track and complete
- **Update regularly** - Keep progress current to maintain usefulness
- **Document decisions** - Record why certain approaches were chosen
- **Link references** - Connect to relevant code, issues, and documentation
- **Estimate realistically** - Better to overestimate than underestimate effort

This planning system helps maintain organization, track progress, and provides a reference for future development work.
